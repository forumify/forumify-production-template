# Forumify Production Template

This template can be used to quickly start a new customizable forumify environment.

If you do not plan on writing custom application logic for your forumify, we recommend just running our docker container instead and skipping this template.

Learn more about hosting forumify on the [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.forumify.net/guides/self-hosting).
